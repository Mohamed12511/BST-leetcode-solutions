// Problem: Check if the value of the root node is equal to the sum of the values of its left and right child nodes.
// Approach:
//          - Simply check if the sum of the left and right child values is equal to the value of the root.
// Time Complexity: O(1), as we are only accessing and comparing the values of a few nodes.
// Space Complexity: O(1), since we are using only a constant amount of space.

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkTree(TreeNode* root) {
        return (root->left->val + root->right->val == root->val);
    }
};
